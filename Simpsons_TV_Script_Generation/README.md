![Moe](Images/moe.png) *(chuckles)* and now, homer, it's only fair that i give youse a beer to my...(quickly) moron.

![Lisa](Images/lisa.png) *(singing)* no, it's what.

![Homer](Images/homer.png) *(happy)* just what did it?

![Moe](Images/moe.png) take that, moe. it's those happy anymore! yeah, we got into another huggenkiss? oh, you can... get too top on what i mean-- what are you doing?

![Carl](Images/carl.png) *(to rafter, disgusted)* well, can you go to me. and you'd cheerier talk to my dog?

![Homer](Images/homer.png) yeah, who are you, moe. but i have to stand in here.

![Moe](Images/moe.png) i just got money with you, homer?

![Barney](Images/barney.png) let me do you want with that.

![Moe](Images/moe.png) please, moe, you just put our money for severe without are or yourself here.

![Carl](Images/carl.png) or tommy tune.

![Homer](Images/homer.png) look at me! i saw a multi-national vigilante exclusive: my, and marge-- and this

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Sentence Generator

This project uses a simple RNN-based sentence generator utilizing [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) model.

The RNN was trained on a small dataset related to "Moe's Tavern" episode. To get better results, [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) should be used for training. Please be warned the training can take multiple days on Pascal-based GPUs.
